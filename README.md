# SWARM 🚀🔥


We're starting with simulations and heading towards real decentralized swarm flights with nano-drones (like Crazyflie). Formation flying, collision avoidance, UWB relative positioning... We're gonna change the world, bro! 😈

## Our Vision
- Start with simple Python simulations (boid algorithms, 3D formations).
- Move to real hardware: Crazyflie nano-drone swarms with UWB modules for indoor/outdoor flights.
- Goals: 10+ drone light shows, search & rescue simulations, fully decentralized control.

## Current Status
- First commit: Simple circle formation simulation (animated with matplotlib).
- Roadmap:
  1. Add collision avoidance (Boids algorithm)
  2. Leader-follower and 3D formations
  3. Real Crazyflie integration (using Crazyswarm2)
  4. UWB ranging simulation

## How to Run
```bash
python grokdost_swarm.py
